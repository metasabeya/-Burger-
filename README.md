This app is built by using Node, Express, handlebars and object relational mapping(ORM).

* Burger App is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be

 devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


*The app store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


- It follows the MVC design pattern and also use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
